# Lecture Topic: Interaction Programming in Web Dev

1. Pet Gallery review
2. Interlude: what is a webpage exactly?
	- web page
	- html
	- css
	- javascript
		- not "safe" compared to java
		- interpreted
		- var whatever = blah blah
		- don't need to define type
3. Lifecycle of a browser loading page
	1. Fetch page --> connect to internet, ask for URL (uniform resource locater), get domain name service to find machine w/ approp. resources (GET request), finally transfer files to you via TCP/IP protocol
	2. Parse --> <!DOCTYPE html>, body is rendered on page
	3. Build up internal repr. of web page
	4. Display
	- [CSE 154](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/20sp/) teaches you how connect the frontend and backend 
4. Flexbox --> nice layout-like functionality for CSS
