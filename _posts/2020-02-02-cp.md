[Hand-drawn notes from Winter 2020](/hw-hints/ColorPicker/2-5-cp-hw-handdrawn.jpeg)

## Application Model Management
1. You should update the text field with current color as text: 
	- **update for starting color!!!!!!!! do not forget!!!!!**
	- correct string format (color hexcode) --> we already give a method to you for this, do not recompute this yourself
2. Remember to update the color square thingy for starting color too
	- you should invoke something... it's in the TODO comments

## App Resiliency
1. need to update background + text when restoring from bundle --> very important!
	- will dock points if you don't do this correctly
2. restore colorpicker view state from bundle after restart
	- remember to use setColor again when restoring the state

## Views
	1. You MUST redraw everytime setColor is called, this is a huge hint for that one TODO comment
	2. The user may touch anywhere INSIDE the rainbow ring and it would still be considered State.INSIDE
