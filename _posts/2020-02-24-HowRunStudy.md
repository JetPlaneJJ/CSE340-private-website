# Topic: Running a Quantitative Study

1. Methods on Reporting in Menus Assignment
	- everything on the report spec that is in italics, you must replace w/ your own content
	- Study Purpose + Tasks = describe goal/same text you used in your consent form, describe 9 conditions of study
	- complete and print out 5 Consent Forms by next week
	- ***IMPORTANT: Benefits of Study = "this study will not benefit me, the tester"
	- IRB (Institutional Review Board) Section --> "if you have any concerns, please contact Professor Jennifer Mankoff... etc"

2. Study Ethics/ Belmont Report
	- *Beneficence = value of research higher than risks*
		- do no physical/mental harm (see Stanford Prison Experiment)
	- *Respect = informed consent*
		- must give users ability to CONSENT or opt-out any time, give results of experiments
		- give users your intent + they fully understand
	- *Justice = equitable, representative selection of participants*
		- bad = only using men for testing --> automobile parts, medicine, crash-test dummies

3. Describe your participants/ Data Collection
	- "they are adept at using mobile phones"\
	- age ranges
	- what genders were represented?
	- what time of day was the data collected?
	- Used an emulator?
	- ***IMPORTANT: Clear your data file before you start the first participant!!
		- Be consistent in how you present the study
		- Download result in A.Studio: View > Tool Windows > Device File Manager > TestResult.csv

4. Reporting
	- select the "raw data" in Google Sheets / Excel
	- **IMPORTANT: REPLACE THE CURRENT SHEET!!!!!!!!**
		- populates the entire pre-made csv with your gathered data
	- must argue whether your hypothesis is VALID
	- Pivot Table Editor: show MAX ERRORS --> Filters > Error? > Showing 2 items
		- do this for speed and error results, use >=1 chart to explain different conditions
