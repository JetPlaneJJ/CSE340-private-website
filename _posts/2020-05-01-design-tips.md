# Design Tips in General
- https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/20sp/slides/wk06/people-motor.html#11

  1. Small --> large targets (maximize size)
  2. Commonly used things together (minimize distance)
  3. Infinite edges
  4. Pie menus for expert tasks
  5. Snapping
  6. Motor Size vs Visible Size (important things bigger)

# Application Design Principals

  1. Consistency (Record This Record That... Stop recording but still "tricked" into accepting????)
  2. Affordances (make the window side have a "groove" appearance so users can think it's easy to grab)
  3. Visible Conceptual Model/Feedback (facebook "blowing up" thumbs up, checkbox highlighted after checked)
