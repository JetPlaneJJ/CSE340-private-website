# Undo Assignment general tips and corrections from Winter 2020 Spec

1. Color Picker: is always red at start of app. Thumb should always reflect current color.
	- **DO NOT PASS COLORPICKER INSIDE TOGGLE MENU!**
	- there is already an AbstractColorPickerView in the given files
	- color picker can be placed anywhere as long as the whole thing is inside the screen :)
	- color picker should CLOSE if user presses inside the wheel and releases anywhere
	- all visible buttons should be grayed out/not usable immediately after clicking color_fab (leave color fab enabled)
	- after clicking color_fab and your picker shows up, then user clicks totally outside wheel, it is ok to close the window or not close it, doesn't matter.
2. onSomethingSelected methods:
	```java
	addCollapsableMenu(R.layout.whatever... this::onSomethingSelected) // do this in order to be able to execute code inside the onSomethingSelected method
	// do this EVEN FOR the color_fab even tho it's no longer a "collapsable menu", most important part is "this::on[Something]Selected"
	```

3. Part 4 ideas: clearing whole screen, dashed/dotted lines when drawing, emoji drawn along path when drawing, fill entire canvas with color...etc
	- Suggestion: use the existing undo and redo classes 

4. Reflection:
	- be sure to **group your data based on "like" issues**, not based on who sent them to you.
	- include specific steps you would take to solve the issues you found with the default Undo app.
	- can suggest new heuristics for the "how well do the heuristics fit"?


Hints from Lecture Winter 2020: 
	- Undo-go to prev action
	- RrvDrawActivity: Contains ALL buttons
	- Rvdrawingact: Implements a class that allows you to undo the redo, allows u to commit actions, calls
	- AbstractDrActvity: No history, adding menus
	- DrawingView: Keeps track of stroke views, has onTouchEvent with Pps state machine
	Possible to implement action: Emojis, dotted lines... THERE IS A WORKSHEET, SEE WEBSITE FOR PDF DOWNLOAD!!!

Hints from Lecture Spring 2020 (5/22):
	- Review: all systems have at least 3 models (Design/what you thought the system should do, System Image: your implementation, User Model/How the user thinks the system works)
